A lot of laptops charge on USB-C now, and some are quite energy efficient with a good battery life like the newer MACs so I think this would be a good feature - the slot in the bag would be with a zip-able hole to let the cord out for charging. The other slots would be as usual - space for books, a slot for a laptop, etc. The main feature of this bag would be the dedicated and waterproofed powerbank slot.  

This solves a lot of problems, running out of charge with no free charging points around - there are indeed charging points but they are often already taken by other people. Likewise, you can charge when you're using the laptop in lesson, this bag is designed in such a way that the charging feature / cable and not messy and obstructive. 

I think students will be interested in this product due to the useful functionality, I've noticed myself when using a powerbank you usually need to put it on the table or faff around with it, or you can leave it in the bag and have the bag open, but that looks messy compared to the solution that I am proposing today.","2025-11-20T08:48:18.168997",0,NA,NA,NA,224,4,3.66666666666667,NA,67.5,NA,NA,NA,2.5,7,2,3,1,1,5,6,5,2,2,1,6,NA,NA,5,3,2,6,6,7,5,4,5,5,6,NA,NA,2,1,1,3,4,5,3,1,2,4,4,NA,NA,3.09090909090909,4.90909090909091,2.72727272727273,11,"691ed38d757c2a89f782465e",500,"26","Male","White","United Kingdom","United Kingdom","United Kingdom","English","No","Full-Time",0.306172479900294,0.269504372135815,0.410392045137372,0.37813390852816,0.265847545772549,4,-0.818074796541634,-0.997138632689184,-0.362344922274055,-0.497476394287361

Create a game style product which contains vouchers with different challenges and IOUs which can be left in place of stolen food.

Or ""I'm sorry I stole your milk, I owe you breakfast in bed"" and the recipient can cash these vouchers in at any time.

The product will also include some blank whiteboard cards where students can customise their own.

The best bit? The base changes colour when you touch it or when it warms up, and it reveals little hidden messages or study prompts to keep you motivated. Perfect for those gloomy UK days, it gives you proper light for late-night studying, keeps your desk organised, and adds a fun, quirky vibe to your uni room. Basically, it’s practical, cheerful, and just a bit magical.","2025-11-20T13:07:05.937102",0,NA,NA,NA,183,3,6,2.8,70,6,7,7,3.16666666666667,5.4,3,7,6,5,3,6,5,7,5,4,5,NA,NA,1,4,6,5,3,5,5,6,5,4,3,NA,NA,1,4,4,3,2,4,2,4,4,3,3,NA,NA,5.09090909090909,4.27272727272727,3.09090909090909,11,"691f111e63688dfad974939e",463,"29","Female","White","United Kingdom","United Kingdom","United Kingdom","English","No","Full-Time",0.346305290446221,0.367566380266312,0.591401184741034,0.608947362095083,0.390532980562403,4.68181818181818,-0.635319709153527,-0.54267133713962,0.369760827832206,0.442889655910774

Refined: Instead of a baton, the Campus Quest Capsule could be a self-driving delivery bot that transports goods between accommodations around the campus. This would be particularly useful at Universities with large campuses. The convenience of a campus robot would allow students to stay in the comfort of their dorms, whilst sending and receiving goods from fellow students on campus. For security reasons, the campus robot will only be available to students attending the university and must be living in on-campus accommodation.","2025-11-20T13:11:41.920996",0,NA,NA,NA,412,7,6,3.8,5,6,7,7,5.16666666666667,7,6,5,3,4,7,5,6,7,6,7,6,NA,NA,2,2,1,2,2,5,3,7,5,5,3,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,5,2,4,1,NA,NA,5.63636363636364,3.36363636363636,1.90909090909091,11,"691f1074f136f7b93b097258",679,"27","Male","Other","United Kingdom","United Kingdom","United Kingdom","English","No","Full-Time",0.325750828466816,0.317857159090832,0.501401827099451,0.515224477535247,0.436661302125445,4.5,-0.727466974034266,-0.763636983444131,0.00560732308991088,0.0609167408904227

Generous margins allow for additional notes and annotations, while the lined pages support organized and structured writing.
